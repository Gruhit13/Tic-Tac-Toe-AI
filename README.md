# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
Tic-Tac-Toe playing AI using Supervised learning Algorithm

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe playing AI that is trained on a Tic-Tac-Toe dataset. 
The main thing about it is that it is uses Supervised learning algorithm.

#########################<-Work Flow Start->###############################

1) Model takes the Board as input in form of 1-D array.
2) For input the model provides its own steps as output.
3) From all valid moves of AI one best move is selected(Programmatically).
4) After every move implement winner is checked for.
5) If either a player or ai wins then winner is declared.
6) Else the same set of instruction is repeated.

### The only limitation of this model is it can play at its best. ###
